"""Wordcount exercise

The main() function is already defined and complete. It calls the
print_words() and print_top() functions, which you fill in.

See the README for instructions.

Use str.split() (no arguments) to split on all whitespace.

Workflow: don't build the whole program at once. Get it to an intermediate
milestone and print your data structure. Once that's working, try for the
next milestone.

Implement the create_word_dict() helper function that has been defined in
order to avoid code duplication within print_words() and print_top(). It
should return a dictionary with words as keys, and their counts as values.
